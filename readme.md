Hi, I'm Stephen. I write programs at [**oidoid**](https://github.com/oidoid), [**Reddit**](https://github.com/reddit), and here. I'm currently making [**Linear Text**](https://github.com/oidoid/linear-text), a graphical line-oriented plaintext editor, and [**void**](https://github.com/oidoid/void), a minimal 2D game engine for small games like [**solitaire**](https://superpatience.com).
